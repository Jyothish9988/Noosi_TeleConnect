## Welcome to NOOSI TeleConnect

Welcome to NOOSI TeleConnect, an innovative solution that combines the power of robotics and telecommunication to reshape the way healthcare is delivered. Our platform is specifically designed to enable hospitals to communicate with patients through videoconferencing and interactive robotic systems, transforming the patient experience and improving healthcare outcomes.

In the face of pandemics and viral spreads, NOOSI TeleConnect emerges as a vital tool to mitigate infection risks for both patients and healthcare providers. With our cutting-edge technology, doctors can remotely handle patient interactions from any part of the world, reducing the need for patients to physically visit hospitals. This not only ensures the safety of hospital faculty but also minimizes the spread of infectious diseases.

Our specialized robots are equipped with advanced capabilities to manage patients and gather crucial medical readings in real-time. These include essential vital signs such as heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, weight measurements, and blood pressure readings. This comprehensive monitoring allows healthcare professionals to deliver accurate diagnoses and personalized care, all from a remote location.

Booking an appointment is made effortless through our secure online system. Once a patient schedules an appointment, available doctors can accept the booking and provide a suitable time slot for the video conference. The NOOSI TeleConnect interface ensures a seamless user experience, allowing patients and doctors to interact efficiently and effectively.

At NOOSI TeleConnect, we are committed to revolutionizing healthcare communication, improving access to quality care, and minimizing infection risks. Join us in embracing the future of remote patient care, where distance is no longer a barrier to receiving exceptional medical attention.
